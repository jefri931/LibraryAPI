# LibraryAPI

1. The db connection string will not work for anyone else so please add your own and update database within the LibraryAPI.Database directory.
2. This project was built on mac and I wasnt able to get the unit tests running at this time since I developed it completely in Visual Studio Code since the standard Visual Studio does not support .NET 8 so I hope they work.
3. I added only one of the services to the tests.
4. You can check out swagger for all the endpoints.
